# LibFM

LibFM is a C++ music library designed to support procedural generation of music. It is not capable of playing music or exporting to midi on its own. We recommend you use FuseMuse (A procedural generation engine, which can be found at https://github.com/sigmaJ/FuseMuse) to facilitate your music generation and to allow you to play and save your compsitions.
